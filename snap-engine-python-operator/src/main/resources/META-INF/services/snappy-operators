# In order to introduce the python operator implementations to SNAP, they need to be listed in this file. On each
# line an operator is specified by its module name (fully qualified = may contain package names) and its Python class
# name: <module> <class>, where <module> <class> need to be separated by one or more whitespaces.
# For example:
#
# cloud_mask_op   CloudMaskOp
# water.mci_op    MciOp
# land.nvdi_op    NdviOp
# land.fapar_op   FaparOp
#
# Thus, latter means, the Python file '<this-directory>/land/fapar_op.py' exists and defines a class named 'FaparOp'.

ndvi_op    NdviOp
